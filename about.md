I'm a Senior at UT, with a graduation date of December 2016. I will graduate with a BA in Computer Science, which I have studied for the past 2 years. I previously obtained some experience and education in Journalism and International Relations before switching majors to Computer Science. As such, I am always interested in opportunities and investigations which combine my skillsets in the different fields. If you think that you might have one, please feel free to shoot me an email, because I'm definitely interested!
